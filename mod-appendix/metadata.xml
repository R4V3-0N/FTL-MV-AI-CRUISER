<![CDATA[ THIS MOD HAS DEPENDENCIES! Make sure to patch "Vertex Tags and Utility Functions" first! (link below)

This mod adds a new race of hard-light AI Avatars from a distant, yet familiar universe.
Content inspired by FTL: Captain's Edition and the Hyperspace Anthology, both by Sleeper Service.

This sample includes:
- AI Cruiser type A, B, and C with achievements! Type A unlocked by default.

- 21 New Weapons
    - Effectors: Field displacers that infiltrate enemy systems and disrupt them with hacking.
    - Auto Laser: A high rate of fire laser equally effective at surpressing shields and disabling systems.
    - Auto Beam: A beam that vastly decreases its cooldown after firing just once, enabling rapid ship destruction.
    - Splitter Beams: A series of 'flak' beams that fire several pinpoint beams over a radius.
    - Ion Bust Beams: Beams which deal double damage to ionized rooms, but clear the ion effect.
    - Tech Minelaucher: Minelauncher that uses cloaking technology for greater destructive potential.
    - EMP Devices: A series of weapons that pops shields, slows shield regeneration, and inflicts ion on room hit.
    - Plasma Projectors: Pure incendiary weapons that can set ships ablaze.
    - Burst Scatter Lasers: A group of lasers that excel at dealing damage to the hull in exchange for unreliable system damage.
    - Melee: Fields and blades of hard light, constructed into... melee weapons!?

- 13 New Drones
    - Sentient AI Microfighters, a set of intelligent piloted drones that are specialised to form a variety of roles.
        - Interceptor Microfighter, a drone that is technically more sentient than you. An evasive drone that focuses fire on enemy defence drones before targeting the ship.
        - Shock Microfighter, piloted by an obnoxious avatar, this drone targets enemy systems with its light EMP device repeatedly while evading enemy fire.
        - Swarm Microfighter, the sword of a run away swarm-intelligence. Every alternating shot assimilates material to create a rudimentary attack drone.
    - Missile Combat Drones: Temporary drones that fires off a small series of missiles before despawning.
    - Focus Beam Defence Drone: a Defence drone that shoots down enemy projectiles with beams, never misses!
    - Combat Plasma Drone: A group of drones equipped with Plasma projectors.
    - Combat Scatter Laser Drone: A Combat drone equipped with a scatter laser.
    - Defense Scatter Laser Drone: A defensive model that fires a tight scatter of lasers at missiles.

- New Weapon Properties
    - X-Ray: Slowly erodes systems and rooms, eventually causing semi-permanent damage.
    - Cascade: Dealing damage to a room on fire causes chaos to erupt.
    - Containment: Reverse energy shielding! Trap enemy weapon fire within their own ship.


- New partial-unique sector with an original sound track made by Altzeus and a familiar track from a cluster far away.
- 2 new hostile enemy ships and 2 accompanying Multiverse Renegades, and one new Multiverse Renegade Boss.

- New Race: AI Avatars, a synthetic race of disposable hardlight avatars with many immunities

- 7 New Augments
    - Hologram Emitter: Lets you produce a new AI Avatar when one perishes at empty beacons.
    - Anti-Gravity Engine: The more punishment your Shields take, the higher your evasion grows!
    - Sentient Combat AI: Increasing the effects of manning a system.
    - Conductive Hull Plating: Allows your ship to create ion storms inside nebulas, and regain lost reactor power in an ion storm.
    - Assimilative Drone Bays: Constructs a temporary drone equipped with a Pinpoint when destroying an enemy drone, or sometimes when taking damage.
    - Rerouted Insulation: Gives the ship an 80% ion resistance, but renders all crew onboard more susceptible to stun.
    - Reflective Armour Plating: Significant resistance to beam weapons.
...and More!
