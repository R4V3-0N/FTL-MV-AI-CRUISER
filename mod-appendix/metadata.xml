<![CDATA[ THIS MOD HAS DEPENDENCIES! Make sure to patch "Vertex Tags and Utility Functions" first! (link bellow)

This mod adds a new race of AI hardlight Avatars from a distant universe which will eventually be developed upon further, both with type B and C layouts as well as eventually events and lore inspired by the AI Avatar race from Captains Edition and Hyperspace by Sleeper Service.

This sample includes:
- AI Cruiser type A, B, and C with achievements!
- 19 New Weapons
  - Effectors: field displacer fields that infiltrates enemy systems and disrupts them with hacking attacks.
  - Auto Beam: a beam that after firing drops to a suppressive rapid strikes.
  - Splitter Focus Beams: a series of 'flak' beams that fire several pinpoint beams over a radius.
  - EMP Devices: a series of weapons that fires projectiles that knocks down multiple layers of shields per hit and deals ion damage only on system hits.
  - Ion Bust Beams: which can deal double damage on ionized rooms but in doing so clears the ion effect.
  - Plasma Projectors: An a range of industrial tools used to incinerate debris that are more than effective at lighting vulnerable ships ablaze.
  - Burst Scatter Lasers: A group of lasers that excels at dealing damage to the ships hull and occasionally deals internal damage.
- 13 New Drones
  - Sentient AI Microfighters, a set of intelligent piloted drones that are specialised to form a variety of roles.
    - Interceptor Microfighter, a drone that is technically more sentient than you. An evasive drone that focuses fire on enemy defence drones before targeting the ship.
    - Shock Microfighter, piloted by an obnoxious avatar, this drone targets enemy systems with its light EMP device repeatedly while evading enemy fire.
    - Swarm Microfighter, the sword of a run away swarm-intelligence. Every alternating shot assimilates material to create a rudimentary attack drone.
  - Missile Combat Drones: Temporary drones that fires off a small series of missiles before despawning.
  - Focus Beam Defence Drone: a Defence drone that shoots down enemy projectiles with beams, never misses!
  - Combat Plasma Drone: A group of drones equipped with Plasma projectors.
  - Combat Scatter Laser Drone: A Combat drone equipped with a scatter laser.
  - Defense Scatter Laser Drone: A defensive model that fires a tight scatter of lasers at missiles.

- New semi-unique sector with an original sound track made by Altzeus and a familiar track from a cluster far away.
- 2 New Hostile enemy ships and 2 accompanying Multiverse Renegades!
- New Race: AI Avatar's, a synthetic race of disposable hardlight avatars with many immunities
- 6 New Augments
  - Hologram Emitter, an augment that lets you produce an AI hologram when one perishes at empty beacons
  - Anti-Gravity Engine, provides evasion when your engines or helm is disabled.
  - Sentient Combat AI, improves manning level of systems
  - Conductive Hull Plating. This hull plating allows your ship to create ion storms inside nebulas and regain lost reactor power in an ion storm.
  - Assimilative Drone Bays. Allowing the construction of temporary focus beam drones for destroyed enemy drones as well as a chance when your ships damaged.
  - Rerouted Insulation, gives the ship a 80% ion resistance while all crew onboard are more susceptible to stuns.
...and More!
