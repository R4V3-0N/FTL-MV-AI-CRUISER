<![CDATA[ THIS MOD HAS DEPENDENCIES! Make sure to patch "Inferno Core" and "Vertex Tags and Utility Functions" first! (links bellow)

This mod adds a new race of AI hardlight Avatars from a distant universe which will eventually be developed upon further, both with type B and C layouts as well as eventually events and lore inspired by the AI Avatar race from Captains Edition and Hyperspace by Sleeper Service.

This sample includes:
- AI Cruiser type A, B, and C with achievements!
- 5 New Weapons
  - Effector mk I, and II; a projector that hacks into enemy systems.
  - Heavy Effector, a projector that hacks and disrupts enemy systems for longer.
  - Chain Effector, a chain variation of the Effector designed to keep enemies disrupted after a few shots.
  - Auto Beam, a beam that after firing drops to a quick 2.5 second cooldown.
  - Splitter Focus Beam I, II, and III; a series of 'flak' beams that fire several pinpoint beams over a radius.
  - EMP Device mk I, and II; a series of weapons that fires projectiles that knocks down 2 layers of shields on impact, and deals ion damage on room hit.
  - Heavy EMP Device, a variation that can knock down more shields and inflicts ion on adjacent rooms.
  - Ion Bust Beam, which can deal double damage on ionized rooms but in doing so clears the ion effect.
- 5 New Drones
  - Interceptor Microfighter, a drone that is technically more sentient than you. An evasive drone that focuses fire on enemy defence drones before targeting the ship.
  - Shock Microfighter, piloted by an obnoxious avatar, this drone targets enemy systems with its light EMP device repeatedly while evading enemy fire.
  - Swarm Microfighter, the sword of a run away swarm-intelligence. Every alternating shot assimilates material to create a rudimentary attack drone.
  - Missile Drone, a temporary drone that fires off a small series of missiles before despawning.
  - Focus Beam Defence Drone, a Defence drone that shoots down enemy projectiles with beams, never misses!
- New Race: AI Avatar's, a synthetic race of disposable hardlight avatars with many immunities
- New Augments
  - Hologram Emitter, an augment that lets you produce an AI hologram when one perishes at empty beacons
  - Sentient Combat computer, improves most systems by 5%
  - Rerouted Insulation, gives the ship a 80% ion resistance while all crew onboard are more susceptable to stuns.
...and More!
