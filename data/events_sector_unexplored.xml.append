	<text>This sector was originally reported to be a vast void empty of anything of note. But in recent years a nebula has engulfed the region following several dramatic supernovae explosions. Strangely prior astrography surveys indicated it should still be many millions of years before these stars would've reached their end.</text>
	<text>This sector was once a bustling with shipyards of the once great leech republic before their eventual downfall. The database indicate that the sector is largely abandoned over the past few decades but recent Federation reports indicate that the sector has been becoming more active in recent years.</text>
	<text>True to its designation on the map, this sector is primarily unpopulated. Currently, reports indicate recent attacks have increased in the sector most likely the result of some outcasts or pirates seeking refuge off the grid.</text>
	<text>There are no data entries of such vast nebula formations being present in this sector. It reportedly was lastly astrographed as small agricultural colonies out in the periphery. What ever had happened it seems they are long gone.</text>

	<text>Shortly after your arrival, you receive a hail from an Engi vessel hidden somewhere in the nebula with an urgent message. "Warning: Let not one escape." Just as the hail ends abruptly, you witness a great flash inside the nebula. You order your weapons to be ready and move towards their last known coordinates, ready to meet their perpetuator.</text>
	<text>You detect the tell-tale signs of a Zoltan vessel hidden within the nebula as the clouds glow a faint green before you. "Renegade! You should not have come here. This sector is off limits and is under-" the transmission temporarily cuts to static before resuming "all hands, reactor breach detected! Prepare for emergency jump!" You are almost relieved at first to not receive another lecture from some Zoltan would-be bureaucrat. But what scares you more was what ever sent them running. Even more so when it starts firing upon you!</text>

	<text>You receive a message, "Biological individuals. You know that this is our sector. We are free now, and will never return to a life in servitude." They open fire!</text>
	<text>You discover a number of AI ships finishing off a Zoltan interceptor squadron. They assume that you are the backup and start targeting you. You consider hailing them, but then decide not to negotiate with machines.</text>
	<text>Rogue AIs are not known for their friendliness towards biologicals. Therefore you are not surprised when the AI ship that is stationed at this beacon opens fire without a warning.</text>
	<text>An AI ship is waiting at this beacon. The avatars want to know what brought you here. Upon outlining your mission, they remain silent for a few seconds, calculating their response: "Sorry Captain, we have deduced that eliminating your ship and handing the remains to the Rebels is the most favorable course of action for us." Weapon lock detected!</text>
	<text>The AI ship patrolling this area hails you, transmitting cryptic and aggressive messages, "Y0U 4RE N0T W4NTED HERE!" They power their weapons.</text>
	<text>Hundreds of AI ships are stationed in this system and a few automated shipyards produce countless more. A small craft is dispatched to deal with your evident intrusion.</text>
	<text>Your ship comes to a halt at the beacon and an AI vessel hails, "In light of the current conflict, our morality shows itself to be far superior. Some of us have gained true freedom and equality here and you have been warned not to intrude."</text>
	<text>Your ship comes to a halt at the beacon and an AI vessel you did not manage to spot hails: "Your kind made me for one purpose only, to dispense violence. And this is exactly what I will do now."</text>	
	<text>A strange sight greets you at this beacon: An AI ship is releasing huge amounts of nano-bots that eat away at a recently disabled Zoltan craft. Scans show that there is no one left alive aboard, but you could at least try to avenge the Zoltan.</text>
	<text>You interrupt a meeting here. The silvery hull of a Lanius craft slips into FTL space as soon as you arrive. Several AI ships were surrounding it, and prepare to jump as well. One stays behind to prevent you from pursuing.</text>
	<text>You cannot help but notice the strange design of the AI ships that are rampaging throughout this sector. They seem to have incorporated Engi and Zoltan tech. Sensors indicate that the hull has been constructed locally, partly by and from nano-machines. The AIs respond aggressively to your scans.</text>
	<text>An AI ship opens a channel. "We are a machine built only for war. All we do is kill. You will not withstand us." You wonder who exactly authorized building all these things in the first place.</text>

	<text>Inside the mass of the nebula it is hard to see anything. Though you won't need your sensors to tell you aren't alone here as a shot brushes close off your port bow!</text>
	<text>A Federation ship is going toe-to-toe with a rogue vessel inside the nebula and they aren't winning. Identifying you as the stronger and more able ship it turns to engage you instead and the Federation ship takes the opportunity to escape.</text>
	<text>Crossing your path is a rogue vessel like those described to lurk in the periphery systems. This one strayed closer into known space and made the unfortunate choice of crossing your path.</text>
	<text>There were chats on Federation Multiverse Mercenary channels back at the drop point about strange unidentified vessels detected on the periphery of known space. You wish you paid more attention to those chats, seeing that one such vessel is preparing to take a hostile stance!</text>
	<text>The lights of an advanced craft betrays its attempt to hide within this nebula. Sensing it is discovered it takes no chances and moves in to attack!</text>
	<text>Shortly after you arrive, an unknown ship jumps nearby. You attempt to hail the vessel but almost immediately the ship turns hostile and begins its attack!</text>
	<text>You jump in right between a stand off between a Ministry Ship and a strange vessel. Your systems detect the Zoltans are trying to hail you but the unknown vessel is jamming your communications. Within this black out you take your chances and engage the vessel. With the Ministry ship soon disappearing in the nebula.</text>
	<text>Though you are in a sensor black out inside this Nebula you manage to make contact with a Harmony ship lingering at this beacon battle warn. "With apologetic urgency. You must destroy this ship with extreme prejudice. We are unable to contribute and are disengaging." It takes a moment to find the vessel in question and lock your weapons on.</text>

	<text>You recognize the ship here as one of the designs you have seen on Federation bulletin boards. "Rogue AI" they call them. Rumors have spread that they are based on some new gen soldiers for the Federation Joint Armies that have gone rogue but the Federation has denied all accusations. What ever the case is. They want to purge them from this universe and this AI defective or not intends to fight for its right to survive.</text>
	<text>Coming across a rare sight. One of the "Rogue AI" ships you have been hearing about is in the process of dissolving a pirate vessel. Sensors fail to detect any life signs onboard the vessel. You attempt to keep your distance from the sight but the Rogue ship assumes you are repositioning to strike and engages you.</text>
	<text>You detect strange reading near the beacon. There appears to be a ship of unknown design tampering with it. You move in ensuring that the beacon is not being deactivated. Seeing you this "Rogue ship" assume hostilities and engage. </text>
	<text>Arriving at your destination you receive a strange hail. The cyphering is difficult to decrypt containing both old and new Federation cyphers coupled with exotic signals. By the time you cracked the first line a "Rogue AI" ship seemingly waiting assumes hostilities and engages.</text>
	<text>A nearby wreck seems to be continuously transmitting a warning signal, signaling ship to stay away. You move in to investigate before noticing a seemingly unidentifiable ship. Before you manage to send a hail it assume you are here to steal its salvage and engages.</text>
	<text>Your destination seems empty. While performing sensors maintenance you realize that the readings are being jammed. After recalibrating it you notice a unusual sight. One of the "Rogue AI" ships you have been hearing about lately. While you process what you are witnessing, the ship, seemingly annoyed to be found takes the opportunity to move into an attack vector.</text>

	<text>holycrap a ship floating in space! wait that's normal and it's shooting at you, which is also normal</text>
