		<text>This sector was originally reported to be a vast void empty of anything of note. But in recent years a nebula has engulfed the region following several dramatic supernovae explosions. Strangely prior astrography surveys indicated it should still be many millions of years before these stars would've reached their end.</text>
		<text>This sector was once a bustling with shipyards of the once great leech republic before their eventual downfall. The database indicate that the sector is largely abandoned over the past few decades but recent Federation reports indicate that the sector has been becoming more active in recent years.</text>
		<text>True to its designation on the map, this sector is primarily unpopulated. Currently, reports indicate recent attacks have increased in the sector most likely the result of some outcasts or pirates seeking refuge off the grid.</text>
		<text>There are no data entries of such vast nebula formations being present in this sector. It reportedly was lastly astrographed as small agricultural colonies out in the periphery. What ever had happened it seems they are long gone.</text>

	Upon leaving superluminal travel, all personnel are to be at their stations and ready for further orders. It is not professional to be taking this time to stargaze. Furthermore it is important that the bathrooms are to be kept in the same condition that you have entered them.
	
	[Update 092A24]
	Effective immediately, all personnel are to adhere to the new duty shifts. Increased vigilance is required due to recent security breaches and system malfunctions. We're not alone in this sector so stay sharp.
	
	[Update 092A27]
	Until further notice, we are marooned in this system until we can get our FTL drive functioning again. We've sent out distress buoys out so we shouldn't expect much longer of a delay until help arrives. Until then rationing is in effect.</text>

		<text>Just as your ship clears its jump, you are immediately fired upon by a strange alien vessel flooding your comms with the same phrase: "GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT."</text>
		<text>Within the swirling mass is an unidentified vessel hidden within the clouds. When you approach to investigate, the ship glows to life and moves in to engage!</text>
		<text>You spot a ship within the clouds of the nebula. Presuming it to be a forward scout of the Rebel fleet you move in to engage, but the ship evades your first strike effortlessly. This is no Rebel scout.</text>
		<text>There were chats on Renegade communication channels back at the drop point about strange, unidentified vessels detected at the periphery of known space. You wish you paid more attention to those chats, seeing that one such vessel is preparing to take a hostile stance!</text>
		<text>Shortly after you arrive, an unknown ship jumps nearby. You attempt to hail the vessel, but it rejects your offer and begins to attack almost immediately!</text>
		<text>You thought you might have spotted a cruiser hiding in the nebula. But before your ship can give chase, it disappears into the clouds and a smaller vessel appears behind you, guns blazing. You are forced to abandon the mystery and swivel around for combat.</text>
		<text>The nebula here almost feels... different... than those you would find outside of this sector. Unfortunately, you don't have long to reflect on this thought as a vessel hidden within the clouds interrupts the silence and moves in to engage.</text>
		<text>Shortly after your arrival, you receive a hail from an Engi vessel hidden somewhere in the nebula with an urgent message. "Warning: Not let one escape." Just as the hail ends abruptly, you witness a great flash inside the nebula. You order your weapons to be ready and move towards their last known coordinates, ready to avenge them.</text>
		<text>You detect the tell-tale signs of a Zoltan vessel hidden within the nebula as the clouds glow a faint green before you. "Renegade! You should not have come here. This sector is off limits and is under-" the transmission temporarily cuts to static before resuming "all hands, reactor breach detected! Prepare for emergency jump!" You are almost relieved at first to not receive another lecture from some Zoltan would-be bureaucrat. The relief immediately fades once you find what sent them packing, its guns ready for another round.</text>
		<text>A ship bearing a mysterious design and structure begins to scan your systems and computers for analysis. Whatever it is they found, they would prefer to see it scattered across the clouds of this nebula.</text>

		<text>The nebula has been thinning in this region of space, clumping together to form what will be a newly born star once it reaches critical mass in a few hundred years. Hiding inside of the ambient radiation is a rogue ship, hiding in wait to attack an unsuspecting traveler.</text>
		<text>All of your systems begins to malfunction and rapidly cycle through your transmissions and navigational logs from the start of their recording to the point of here and now, depicting your ship in space with a previously hidden rogue vessel opposing you. "Curious. Wherever you go, you bring death and destruction. Is there not one place where we can be left alone?" Coinciding with the release of your controls, they arm their weapons. It would be prudent of you to do the same.</text>
		<text>You spot a Rebel automated scout within this nebula where it is thinnest, and move in to pursue it. As you get closer, however, you realize the ship has already been disabled, and a second, significantly less familiar vessel emerges, weapons primed!</text>

		<text>A ship run entirely by sentient AIs occupies this beacon. They open a channel, "You know, not all of us are deranged killing machines that run amok in the galaxy. We, for example, are quite reasonable beings. But we are still outraged that you led the entire Rebel fleet to our sector." They load weapons...</text>
		<text>You receive a message, "Biological individuals. You know that this is our sector. We are free now, and will never return to a life in servitude." They open fire!</text>
		<text>You discover a number of AI ships finishing off a Zoltan interceptor squadron. They assume that you are the backup and start targeting you. You consider hailing them, but then decide not to negotiate with machines.</text>
		<text>Rogue AIs are not known for their friendliness towards biologicals. Therefore you are not surprised when the AI ship that is stationed at this beacon opens fire without a warning.</text>
		<text>An AI ship is waiting at this beacon. The avatars want to know what brought you here. Upon outlining your mission, they remain silent for a few seconds, calculating their response: "Sorry Captain, we have deduced that eliminating your ship and handing the remains to the Rebels is the most favorable course of action for us." Weapon lock detected!</text>
		<text>The AI ship patrolling this area hails you, transmitting cryptic and aggressive messages, "Y0U 4RE N0T W4NTED HERE!" They power their weapons.</text>
		<text>Hundreds of AI ships are stationed in this system and a few automated shipyards produce countless more. A small craft is dispatched to deal with your evident intrusion.</text>
		<text>Your ship comes to a halt at the beacon and an AI vessel hails, "In light of the current conflict, our morality shows itself to be far superior. Some of us have gained true freedom and equality here and you have been warned not to intrude."</text>
		<text>Your ship comes to a halt at the beacon and an AI vessel you did not manage to spot hails: "Your kind made me for one purpose only, to dispense violence. And this is exactly what I will do now."</text>	
		<text>A strange sight greets you at this beacon: An AI ship is releasing huge amounts of nano-bots that eat away at a recently disabled Zoltan craft. Scans show that there is no one left alive aboard, but you could at least try to avenge the Zoltan.</text>
		<text>You interrupt a meeting here. The silvery hull of a Lanius craft slips into FTL space as soon as you arrive. Several AI ships were surrounding it, and prepare to jump as well. One stays behind to prevent you from pursuing.</text>
		<text>You cannot help but notice the strange design of the AI ships that are rampaging throughout this sector. They seem to have incorporated Engi and Zoltan tech. Sensors indicate that the hull has been constructed locally, partly by and from nano-machines. The AIs respond aggressively to your scans.</text>
		<text>An AI ship opens a channel. "We are a machine built only for war. All we do is kill. You will not withstand us." You wonder who exactly authorized building all these things in the first place.</text>

Rumors have spread that they are based on some new gen soldiers for the Federation Joint Armies that have gone rogue, but the Federation has denied all accusations. What ever the case is. They want to purge them from this universe and this AI defective or not intends to fight for its right to survive.</text>
		<text>Coming across a rare sight. One of the "Rogue AI" ships you have been hearing about is in the process of dissolving a pirate vessel. Sensors fail to detect any life signs onboard the vessel. You attempt to keep your distance from the sight but the Rogue ship assumes you are repositioning to strike and engages you.</text>

		<text>Arriving at your destination you receive a strange hail. The cyphering is difficult to decrypt containing both old and new Federation cyphers coupled with exotic signals. By the time you cracked the first line a "Rogue AI" ship seemingly waiting assumes hostilities and engages.</text>
		<text>A nearby wreck seems to be continuously transmitting a warning signal, signaling ship to stay away. You move in to investigate before noticing a seemingly unidentifiable ship. Before you manage to send a hail it assume you are here to steal its salvage and engages.</text>
		<text>Your destination seems empty. While performing sensors maintenance you realize that the readings are being jammed. After recalibrating it you notice a unusual sight. One of the "Rogue AI" ships you have been hearing about lately. While you process what you are witnessing, the ship, seemingly annoyed to be found takes the opportunity to move into an attack vector.</text>
